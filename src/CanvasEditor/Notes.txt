Things to Do:
=== Upon Node deletion, Node Comment must be deleted as well
=== Upon Node Comment deletion, Node properties must be set
=== If Comment is empty, and is no longer selected/focused, delete
=== If Comment is being edited and is no longer selected/focused on, set back to previously submitted Comment
=== Focus on Comment Creation or edit
=== If Comment is empty but previously submitted, set back to previous Comment
=== Fix Clipboard shortcuts selection bug
- Finalize Clipboard shortcuts
- Make Comment textboxes reponsive
- Finish Updating Edge Function
- Edit Edge connect zone
- Output Display not updating

END OF BUGS
--------------
- Create Block Comments
- Clock Inputs
    - Rising Edge: low-to-high (starts at 0)
    - Falling Edge: high-to-low (starts at 1)
    - Clock Period
- Simulation Mode
    - To reduce computation
        - Save static nodes in array
        - Save dynamic nodes in array
        - Only update dynamic nodes each clock cycle
    - Simulate (if indefinite, run on time multiplier)
    - Step (starting the clock, stepping through each node)
    - Clock Step (running one clock cycle)
- Implement Basic Nodes
- Create SVGs of the Nodes
- Redo and Undo Shortcuts



Comment Nodes:
**** On Comment Node deletion, set all the necessary variables
** Add focus on Comment Node creation
** Add focus on Comment Node edit 
** Fix formatting of text box when long comment is added
* Make responsive when size of viewport changes
